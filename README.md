# ☁️ Word Cloud Chrome Extention ☁️

Ever went to a website with just walls and walls of text and feel overwhelmed? Ever wish you could press a button to see the most important parts of a page?

## Key Takeaways:

- use manifest to execute background.js, look into <a href ="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/scripting/">scripting</a> compared to content_scripts <br>
- execute main js script by calling through background.js, targeting current tab <br>
- some pages use headers more than paragraphs

## Todo mayhaps:

- limit word cloud to top 50 most used words, adding new words when old words are removed
- wrap bubble into shape
- other way to keep all the content on a page without scrolling
- fix issue on pages with small body element that causes text to overlap
- improve transitions maybe more bouncy
- maybe bar graph/pie chart
